# Digital-Counter-with-7-Segment-Display
- Tech Stack: 74LS47 BCD to 7-Segment Decoder IC, 7-Segment Display (SSD), Switches, Voltage Regulator, 9V Battery  
- Designed a digital counter circuit using the 74LS47 IC to convert BCD inputs into 7-segment display outputs.  
- Integrated four switches to provide binary-coded decimal (BCD) inputs, enabling manual control of the displayed values.  
- Powered by a 9V battery with a voltage regulator for stable operation, showcasing practical implementation of BCD-to-SSD decoding.
